       "'[\"I\\'ve been meaning to try this place out for the last two years. Now it\\'s one of my favourite seafood places. \\\\n\\\\nThe only downside is that the entire restaurant can fit 30 customers MAX so getting in is quite a challenge. \\\\nYou can either get a reservation, add yourself to the Yelp waitlist, or go there later in the evening around 9pm.\\\\n\\\\nI added myself to the waitlist and then the restaurant texted me when the table was almost ready. Luckily there are many bars in the area, so you can stop by somewhere beforehand and grab a drink while you wait. \\\\n\\\\nWe had the shrimp & uni butter (wonderful), the fettuccine with clams (my favourite), and 6 different types of oysters. You write down the type and number of oysters that you want on the menu and they lay the oysters out in that order. \\\\n\\\\nThe bartenders and waiters are also super friendly and we felt very welcomed.\\\\n\\\\nIt may be hard to come back, but I would definitely recommend this to others.\", \"Waking into Upstate you think it\\'s a small hole in the wall restaurant that only serves burgers and fries. But you would be so wrong. \\\\n\\\\nWe sat at a high top table and the server came over after a few minutes and asked if anything interesting pops up off of the menu. \\\\n\\\\nBeing that it was happy hour and they had oyster specials , Jeffrey was in heaven. But we didn\\'t know what type of oysters to get so he helped us choose. \\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered the tuna tartare, the charred octopus and the bone marrow with seared scallops. \\\\n\\\\nThe oysters were really good and fresh. There was two of them that were very small and when I went to eat one it just popped down my throat. I thought that was hilarious. \\\\n\\\\nThen he brought out the tuna. It was really tasty. Not the best I\\'ve ever had but definitely not the worst.  \\\\n\\\\nThen for the main course. This was my first time ever having bone marrow. Being that it was with scallops was just a major plus. The marrow was absolutely delicious. It was very buttery and savory. Mix that in with the scallops it was a brilliant combination. \\\\n\\\\nHis octopus however was not the winner of the night. It was rubbery and charred a bit too much. We didn\\'t even eat half of it. \\\\n\\\\nWhen he came over to ask if we wanted anything else I had said no and he asked how everything was so I told him about the octopus. He said oh ok. Then brought us the check. LOL. \\\\n\\\\nAll in all definitely try the bone marrow and the oysters. They are both out of this world.\", \"I am so disappointed. Upstate has been on my list for awhile now, and we finally got over there on date night. It\\'s not even that my expectations were too high, what started out as the perfect dinner and the perfect choice of restaurants, slowly fizzled into a major disappointment.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s get to the thing that I really liked first, the oysters. That\\'s what put Upstate on our must try date night radar. I\\'m a bit obsessed with oysters. We ordered a dozen, six from the happy hour options and six from the waiter\\'s recommendations. \\\\n\\\\nThey were good. I expected something a bit more sensational. These seemed better than most. Just not something I\\'d race back for again. I didn\\'t even keep the list of which ones were which, I was so less than enthused. With the likes of Cull and Pistol, Crave and, even, Good Night Sonny nearby, there are places that score much higher, even during happy hour.\\\\n\\\\nThe ambience is pretty cool. It definitely wasn\\'t what I expected, but that\\'s a good thing. Given the minimalist site design and upscale looking menu, I expected something that fit that look. What a delightful surprise to find it more of a neighborhood hole in the wall that served extremely fresh (they don\\'t have a freezer to store things in, so all the food they serve is fresh for that day) and extremely upscale offerings at extremely reasonable prices. \\\\n\\\\nFor starters we went with the tuna tartar. Delicious.\\\\n\\\\nBut that\\'s where things started to go astray. What started out as great service, quickly became more blah service. Not bad, not good. Just blah. You could tell he\\'s been there for awhile. More like going through the motions.\\\\n\\\\nI ordered the octopus. The hubby ordered the bone marrow with scallops.\\\\n\\\\nThe octopus was so over cooked, burnt (there\\'s charred for flavor, and charred like the remnants of burned down building) and inedible. Jayson wanted me to send it back. But, I didn\\'t want to go through all of that or be there longer than necessary. I love octopus. I hated this. I couldn\\'t even eat it.\\\\n\\\\nThe bone marrow was OMG delicious. I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s now our new obsession.\\\\n\\\\nThe scallops though, eh. Jayson loves scallops and he was so excited to be going somewhere that had fresh ones. But, it was lackluster.\\\\n\\\\nIn all, it was just an okay meal, until you realize you spent $100 on food that was either blah or not edible. I don\\'t see racing back anytime soon, at all.\", \"Upstate specializes in seafood, and it\\'s a very casual and intimate spot, allowing me to enjoy fresh seafood without paying exorbitant prices for a hoity-toity environment. We ordered oysters along with a few appetizers and entrees which ranged from phenomenal to mediocre.\\\\n\\\\nOysters: I tried a good sample of both the happy hour East Coast oysters, along with a few West Coast oysters. The Kumamato oysters were good, but I especially liked the Purple Mountain. The Olympia was itty bitty and had an unpleasant texture and flavor to me. It was somewhat rich and mild at the same time. For the East Coast oysters, the Cup Cake ones were big but much too mild. I really enjoyed the Big Rock most of all. It was deliciously briny and flavorful. The accoutrements were simple: crushed horseradish, lemon wedges, cocktail sauce, and vinegar. That\\'s all I need for oysters.\\\\n\\\\nMarlin crudo with caviar: Pretty tasty with a bit of black sturgeon caviar, but it was too salty for me.\\\\n\\\\nTuna tartare: This was really delicious, especially when mixed with that sweet and savory sesame ginger reduction. It reminded me of the flavors of traditional poke with more sauciness.\\\\n\\\\nUni: Hands down the best item we tried. Holy moly was it delicious. It came with salmon roe, carrot puree, raw egg, and toast points. Such an explosion of different flavors and textures from the buttery savoriness of the uni (though milder than expected), the fishiness of salmon roe, the sweet lightness of the carrot puree, and the silky richness of the egg yolk. Everything melded perfectly together, and the bread was perfect for sopping up all the sauces and flavors. I would return just to get one of these for myself.\\\\n\\\\nFettuccine with clams: Everyone raved about this, but sadly, it was underwhelming. The pasta, though perfectly al dente, was kind of flavorless. The clams were juicy and flavorful, but there was a surprising amount of sand.\\\\n\\\\nDeep diver scallops over mushroom brown rice risotto: While the scallops were delicious and perfectly cooked, the risotto was also kind of bland and underwhelming. Clearly they know their seafood, but their bases leave something to be desired.\\\\n\\\\nYou get slices of complimentary whiskey pound cake along with your check. Parts were a little dry but it was still a very flavorful, perfectly sweetened cake with just a hint of that whiskey flavor. My friend asked if he could purchase the cake by itself, but no dice.\\\\n\\\\nNot everything was a winner, but I sampled enough delicious things to want to come back and try some other dishes. Plus I need another taste of that uni appetizer, stat.\", \"Upstate is a decent seafood option in the east village. The menu is a crowd pleaser and the happy hour deal is great. The only catch is - the restaurants is small and reservations can be tricky to get. I wouldn\\'t suggest Upstate for a large crew. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve been here a handful of times and have tried most of their menu. Go during happy hour and get all oysters they offer. I\\'m a huge fan of their escargot and uni dish to start. Their menu changes but of their staples, the fettucine and clams is my favorite entree. It\\'s simple and rich but it\\'s beautifully prepared with al dente pasta. Their most popular menu item is the scallops over risotto - it\\'s good but it\\'s not memorable. \\\\n\\\\nThe prices are good (most dishes being under $20) so I\\'d go and try a bunch of items. Not bad for a seafood joint.\", \"I had been looking for a good seafood restaurant in the area and decided to give it a try after I had read really great reviews. It\\'s a small place so you definitely want to try to make a reservation or get on the waitlist using Yelp. We waited a little over an hour on the waitlist and ordered a few different things right away to share. The tuna tartare came out almost immediately, which tasted very fresh and is a great starter. The remaining courses took a while to be brought out, but it was worth the wait. My favorite dish was by far the fettuccine with clams. It doesn\\'t have a heavy cheese sauce on it, which I enjoyed and the clams paired well. The prices are reasonable for the dishes ($15-$18). The food was good, but I\\'m not in any rush to get back there\", \"We came here for dinner. Not bad if you like seafood and I do. They have some pretty good oysters. The moo moo was my fav also one of the bigger ones. \\\\n\\\\nFor appetizers we had the Uni and Tuna tartar. I liked the Uni the best it came with some ikura, onions, carrot purée , and an egg that made the combo mesh all together really well. \\\\n\\\\nOur entrees were the Scallops and the octopus. We liked the scallops and the risotto that came with the octopus the best. The risotto that came with the scallops wasn\\'t bad either, had good mushrooms. But the risotto with the octopus had truffle and caviar. \\\\n\\\\nFor dessert they brought us some pound cake which was delicious. \\\\n\\\\nOverall good experience. Make a reservation ahead! Pretty small inside like all NY restaurants.\", \"Came here for oysters happy hour and it didn\\'t disappoint! They have rotating oysters on the happy hour menu, but it\\'s usually 3 different selections. You have to pair it with either a beer or wine in order to get the deal though - so 6 oysters + a beer for $12, or + a wine for $16. It\\'s a pretty small space so make a reservation if possible (they use yelp!).\\\\n\\\\nWe got a couple of new brunswick, canada, some from prince edward island, canada, and north fork, long island. They all tasted very fresh, but were on the salty side. Our favorite was the new brunswick one - although it was salty, you still get a kick of sweetness at the end the more you chew on it :) The staff also gave us some complimentary cake at the end, that was really nice for new years day!\\\\n\\\\nFrom what I saw other people order (and what my nose was able to smell haha), it all looked pretty amazing. Looking forward to coming back and tasting some real food!\", \\'Read in a review/article somewhere to come and try the fettuccine with clams, so that\\\\\\'s exactly what I did. Actually, I tried TWICE to do that (solo, because apparently, that\\\\\\'s how you significantly improve your chances of getting a seat without a res -- and that certainly proved to be true). The first time, the wait (FOR ONE. AT THE BAR.) was too long, so I circled back another evening. The hostess told me it\\\\\\'d take ~30 min., but it ended up only being like ~5 min. -- weird wait time operations, I\\\\\\'d say...but the bottom line is to not venture too far if you decide to get on the list. \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m glad I gave it a go, because the fettucine WAS phenomenally done. A sizable portion, well seasoned, the pasta cooked perfectly al dente. I sometimes get tired of rich pastas after a few forkfuls, but this one was not too overwhelming and I finished it off, no problem. Was tempted to get an accompanying glass of wine (quite the selection they have, though not cheap -- think $12-16 glasses), but it was a \"school night\". ;) No dessert menu, but they serve you a complimentary small slice of whiskey cake at the end, which was tasty and a nice way to round out the meal. \\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\\\'s a small and cozy restaurant (hence, the wait times even on weekday evenings), but definitely worth a visit -- try to make a reservation if you\\\\\\'re coming with a group. I would cap it at 4 max.\\', \"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. \\\\n\\\\nAnother limited space restaurant in NYC, I recommend making reservations as there isn\\'t much room to wait inside. We did so via Yelp app. \\\\n\\\\nWe had reservations at 5 pm, as soon as they opened. The restaurant was immediately filled and within 5 minutes, people were told to expect a 45 minute wait. \\\\n\\\\nTheir happy hour consists of a beer and 6 oysters for $12. The oysters were fresh and came with 3 toppings/sauces. There\\'s the option to get wine and 6 oysters for $16. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the clam fettuccine and my boyfriend got the ciopinni. His dish came with bread to be dipped in the tomato broth. The amount of seafood he received was plentiful, rich flavor, and fresh. My clam fettuccini was by far my favorite dish from my entire week trip in NYC. \\\\n\\\\nOur waiter also gave us a complimentary desert followed by our meal! \\\\n\\\\nIf you love seafood, I highly highly recommend coming here!! You will not be disappointed and the price is definitely fair!\", \"Description: Seafood focused restaurant with lots of beer and wine. They have a good happy hour special which is 6 oysters and a beer for $12 \\\\n\\\\nService: Everything is served pretty quickly. They do a good job considering how many people they manage to fit into this small place \\\\n\\\\nAtmosphere: The inside is very dimply lit. There is a small bar area. It\\'s a good place for friends/date, but not families. \\\\n\\\\nItems Tasted:\\\\n- Fettuccine with Clams: This is the best dish here out of everything I tried. The sauce is great and not too salty. The pasta and clams are great as well \\\\n- Today\\'s scallop special: The scallops are fresh. The mushroom risotto is yummy too, but I feel like it could have a bit more flavoring  \\\\n- Octopus: The risotto is great. When they say charred, they mean it. If you don\\'t like the char taste, don\\'t get it \\\\n- House-cured sockeye salmon: The salmon was very very salty. It\\'s a good dish, if you like this type of food\\\\n- Oysters: Very fresh. It\\'s interesting to try a few from different places to taste the subtle difference\", \"Awesome seafood restaurant in the East Village. I made reservations for a Friday night dinner. Our table was immediately ready at our requested time. We started off with oysters and shrimp for appetizers. The Shrimp was amazing and atop some type of cornbread cake type thing. I don\\'t know what it was, but it was amazing. \\\\n\\\\nMain entree for me was the mahi mahi with potatoes and my friend had scallops with mushroom risotto. Both dishes were absolutely incredible; the only negative thing I could think of is that I wanted more and more and more. Our server was super polite and helped me, someone who doesn\\'t really like shellfish, navigate their gigantic oyster menu. The food was served promptly and was incredibly fresh and authentic. For how good the seafood is, the restaurant is fairly priced. Like all restaurants in the East Village, it\\'s small, but I never felt cramped. It\\'s so convenient that they take reservations through yelp.\", \"After reading so many positive reviews I\\'ve decided to try the update seafood restaurant for my self. I can here with my family and friends for a little get together. We ordered two dozen of west coast oysters, shrimps, calamari. I must say I was really impressed with the quality of oysters. They were really meaty and fresh which is very important for me. Evening else wasn\\'t so good for my taste. The calamari were a little over cooked and hard to chew. The shrimp was ok, I\\'ve had better in the past. The beer was ok, even though it was a tap bear, it want my favorite. Overall the food was ok here, I might come back for another try.\", \\'First time here, my friend and cohort picked this spot and I was happy to oblige since they cater toward seafood and shellfish.  In case you haven;t figured it by now, I devour anything seafood.\\\\n\\\\nMoving on, we started with a bottle of the Cali Sauv Blanc to compliment in the variety of what we were about to partake.  From the east and west coast oysters at regular price, to the impeccably surprising ceviche which looked like anything but; everything was simple mar-ve-lous.\\\\n\\\\nThe tuna tartar was subtle, yet flavorful.  The oysters were chucked to perfection.  We indulged in the cowboy, the komo-something and the huge creamy one which was our least fave.\\\\n\\\\nService was attentive, not intrusive.  We were not rushed, even though it was full on a Thursday evening around 7:30pm when we wete seated.  Cheerio.\\', \\'The Food: The oysters (5/5) were shucked perfectly - no stray shells or strange fishy taste. We got a mix of west and east coast oysters, and thoroughly enjoyed them all. There were quite a few local oysters from Long Island on the menu, which were unique from other oyster bars that we have been to. The other small plates that we ordered (scallops w/ mushroom risotto, shrimp with sea urchin butter, crab cakes) were underwhelming (3/5).\\\\n\\\\nThe Drinks: 5/5. Excellent selection of wine and beer. The bartender introduced us to Grüner Veltliner, a dry white wine from Austria that is a delicious alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.\\\\n\\\\nThe Service: 5/5. The service was amazing! Our bartender, Shane, was attentive and very knowledgeable about wine and oysters. Other staff members were friendly as well.\\\\n\\\\nUpstate is a chill, intimate place that is great for a casual date night or to catch up with a friend. Highly recommend coming here for their fresh oysters and excellent service.\\', \"Awesome cozy little spot in East Village! It gets super crowded on the weekends, so I recommend making reservations a day ahead.\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered some oysters to start, then monkfish and clams with linguine for our entree\\'s. The food was DELICIOUS, I wish the portions were a little bigger since I didn\\'t want to stop eating!!\\\\n\\\\nI definitely savored every bite. I\\'ll be back again soon!\", \\'Great seafood at this cozy spot in East Village. The oysters are incredible, great draft beer and the main entrees are fantastic. We had a reservation for 3, but had to wait at the bar for 20-30 minutes past our time to get a table. The bar was quite crowded while waiting, but if you\\\\\\'re able to find a seat, it\\\\\\'s not too bad of a wait (just grab a beer).\\\\n\\\\nWe ordered oysters as an appetizer and they were fantastic and fresh. You can pick from different areas on their little \"oyster menu.\" I got the mahi mahi which was incredible. I also tried a bit of the scallops on risotto - also very tasty. \\\\n\\\\nFor seafood, not too expensive but you will have to wait quite a while. Definitely get a reservation though. Overall, would come back and/or bring friends when visiting.\\', \\'Date night!!!\\\\nTime to surprise my Queen with a new spot, new experience, and keep this adventure going.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUpstate wasn\\\\\\'t my first choice, it was more like the 4th but something told me that it would be the one...and without a doubt it was.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhile heading to Manhattan I checked the wait time (via yelp) and it didn\\\\\\'t seem that bad; I had to get to her, we gotta get to the spot, and we\\\\\\'ll probably grab a drink while waiting for a table. This was my logic but I completely forgot that it was SATURDAY NIGHT. Lol\\\\n\\\\nScooped her from work, hopped in a cab, and followed up on my check-in confirmation from upstate. Hmm, \"why didn\\\\\\'t they respond?\" I thought to myself as we got closer and closer and closer. \"Sh!t, are we going to get turned away at the door? Crap, how do I fix this while keeping things calm and not spoiling the night?\" My mom taught me to follow through and we were already enroute, no turning back now. So we get there and there\\\\\\'s a crowd of about 7 people waiting outside (in the cold). We weren\\\\\\'t there to see them so I walked past and informed the maître d of my reservation... she didn\\\\\\'t give a promising response and I backed my stance with conviction. We were not getting turned away!! She said to check back in 30mins and we returned in 27 ;).... And guess who got two seats at the bar? We did :D.\\\\n\\\\nFinally seated in this packed, warm, little restaurant we began to peruse the menu...at least she began, I already knew I wanted the swordfish. John Luke was the gentleman\\\\\\'s name and service was his forte. He gave us the rundown about the happy hour oysters, which we made it in time for as well as other menu suggestions to pair with the beer and wine they served. My Queen began with the red and planned to finish with the white, I went the IPA route and they both turned out to be wise choices. Out appetizer was amazingly delicious...house curse salmon, lightly covered with onions, capers, sided with sweet whole grain mustard, and a traditional baguette. This combination was genius and a great start to what came next.  John Luke kept offering oysters and I kept declining, thinking he was trying to up-sell but THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. (keep reading)\\\\n\\\\nOur entrees came and the first thing that hit me was the heavenly smell...mind you, we already told John that dairy is a no for me so he opted for a few substitutions in my meal. The grilled swordfish comes with creamy mashed potatoes so he asked them to grill a few extra taters for me and mix in some more veggies, it worked out and looked beautiful. The swordfish was well seasoned, cooked perfectly, and went exceptionally well with the grilled potatoes and touch of lemon juice. My Queen got the Grilled Tuna and I was immediately jealous. IT. LOOKED. DELICIOUS!!!!! She cut into the tender fish and it melted on the knife, she gave the most gleeful smile before devouring it lol....that\\\\\\'s what you get when you\\\\\\'re with a #Foodiewithafro. After dinner, yes I said after we accepted John\\\\\\'s offer to try the oysters.\\\\n\\\\nWe went with his suggestion; Blue Island #9, Gildden Point, and Blue Whale... 2 of each.\\\\nThe setup was impressive and those Blue Whales were meals within themselves. Ideally I\\\\\\'d say 6 would be a great starter for one person, if they plan to have an entree afterwards otherwise get 12. A dozen of these babies (anything except the Whale...get less Whales lol) would be enough to get someone through the night, with a drink or two. I foolishly devoured my share while she carefully decorated hers for the ultimate flavor...again I was jealous lol. Can\\\\\\'t forget to add the complimentary slices of whiskey cake we received afterwards. Delish!\\\\n\\\\nAfter the meals were gone and our tummies happy, we sat there and ordered a drink for the road. We glanced around and noticed that EVERYONE was enjoying their experience there, either by means of conversation, drinks, food, or what have you. The place gives a general sense of calm and welcoming. \\\\n\\\\nThis turned out to be another amazing date night and of course I added it to my list... to be released to the yelp public soon. ;)\\\\n\\\\nFood: 5/5\\\\nService: 5/5\\\\nAmbiance: 5/5\\\\nWait time: 4.5/5 (utilize the online booking PLZ)\\\\nStaff: 5/5 (very helpful....talking about you John)\\\\nPrice: 5/5\\\\nFreshness of oysters: 5/5\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCash and credit happily accepted here....WAIT WAIT WAIT.\\\\nAlmost forgot the tunes!!! Yo, John your music choice had us vibin at the bar. Thank you!!!!!\\', \"This spot is located in the LES and has a great menu. I like this spot because their menu isn\\'t too lengthy and all of the dishes that they have listed are super flavorful. We made a reservation in advanced - good thing we did because it got quite packed towards the end of our meal. As an appetizer we ordered the oyster special. If you order 1/2 dozen oysters, you pay a special on either a glass of wine or beer. For appetizers we ordered the uni and tuna tartar. Both were hits and a great balance since the uni was more on the decadent side and the tuna was light and fresh. For entree, we ordered the scallops risotto which has mushrooms mixed into it and the clam fettuccine. The fettuccine was by far our favorite. It had a ton of garlic and was super flavorful.\\\\n\\\\nMy one complaint about the restaurant is that it is a tight squeeze. I would not recommend this place for large parties as you should be cautious when walking in between tables and making sure you don\\'t knock into anyone\\'s glasses.\", \"I\\'ve been wanting to try this place for years and finally got to come to NYC and came here last Thursday night!\\\\n\\\\nI made reservations online which was super easy on the day of for 5:30 pm and there seemed to be a lot of availability.\\\\n\\\\nIt was oyster happy hour 5-7pm, 6 oysters and any beer for $12. There were 3 different kinds of east coast oysters. I got 2 of each and they were all good! My favorite were the Malpeques from prince edward island. \\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered the uni appetizer, crab cake appetizer, scallop entree, and of course fettuccini with clams.\\\\n\\\\nThe uni appetizer was phenomenal. It came with an egg yolk and salmon roe over carrot puree. The uni was super fresh and there was actually a good amount of uni for 2 people to share but of course I had it all to myself! So happy.\\\\n\\\\nThe scallops were also very good - nicely cooked and served over brown rice risotto with mushroom.\\\\n\\\\nThe fettuccini with clams was amazing too. The clams are very briny and flavorful - goes really well with the buttery fettuccini noodles.\", \\'I joined the online waitlist via the Yelp app 45 minutes before I got there and had to wait an additional 15 minutes to be seated on a Wednesday evening. The hostess explained that a health inspector was there for an unexpected visit and it was slowing things down significantly in the kitchen. My friend and I considered going somewhere else to eat, but the restaurant\\\\\\'s \"A\" health score and excellent reviews on Yelp convinced us to stay. Every NYC restaurant gets an unannounced inspection once a year and we figured this would be our one opportunity to be a fly on the wall during one of these events. We therefore decided to stay and order dinner.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant was much smaller than we had anticipated, with a dark interior and tables nestled closely together. My friend and I were initially offered a seat right by the door, but we opted to sit by the bar and wait for a high-top table a little further inside the restaurant. We scored a high-top table five minutes after we sat down at the bar and we gladly scooted over. Our waitress was calm and friendly, but the other staff in the restaurant seemed anxious as the inspector conducted her audit and carefully documented her findings. \\\\n\\\\nMy friend ordered a glass of white wine and I ordered a glass of Bordeaux. I didn\\\\\\'t love the wine. It wasn\\\\\\'t freshly opened and it had a weird smell. I couldn\\\\\\'t figure out if it was from the wine or from the glass itself. This restaurant specializes in oysters and beers, so ordering wine was not the best move.\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and I had worked up an appetite and were looking forward to trying some of the seafood dishes. She ordered the fettuccine with clams, which was pretty good. I ordered the Octopus dish, but it was a miss for me. The octopus needed more seasoning and I wasn\\\\\\'t a fan of the truffle caviar. \\\\n\\\\nI wasn\\\\\\'t wowed by the food or the experience. C\\\\\\'est la vie. On to the next one!\\', \\'This place is spectacular in every way for seafood lovers!  The food is delicious and perfectly portioned.  The prices are very fair.  The environment is really cool as well and nice for a date too.  They have a great happy hour special on oysters and a drink for $12 that is probably mentioned in near every review.\\\\n\\\\nI had the opportunity to try a few of their dishes and all were superb.  First, naturally, started with their happy hour special and ordered a dozen oysters.  We got each kind that was available for happy hour and they were fresh and tasty, not one disappointed.  We got the Marlin crudo appetizer which was so packed with flavor, the creme fraiche was a perfect tasty counter balance to what seemed to be a soy based marinade.  So good!    There was another fish appetizer as well that we had and it was also really good.  The main dish I had was perfectly cooked Octopus over a bed of risotto with truffle oil.  Again, amazing.  The person I was with had the fish special of the day, and he really enjoyed it as well.\\\\n\\\\nThe service and staff were also spectacular, in particular John who was working the bar where we were seated.\\\\n\\\\nThis will now easily be my go to seafood joint!\\', \"Cute cozy place on 1st ave. We were looking for a good place to sample some oysters and this one did the trick. We got there with no reservation and it was really helpful that we can check the status of our seat via yelp... kudos Yelp on that efficient technology! Once we sat down it was a bit tight but given the location it\\'s understandable but it was a nice experience we sampled some oysters a la carte and got two dishes to share. The Waitress was helpful and attentive with explaining the selection of oysters and helped us pick out the best ones. Over all a good experience and we got a whiskey glazed pound cake at the end complimentary which was quite delicious :-)\", \\'Great place. I came here for dinner with a few friends. If you like seafood like it do, you would love it.\\', \"I WANTED to love everything about this place but I just didn\\'t:\\\\nPros\\\\n-Friendly service\\\\n-Cute interior and atmosphere (although very dark)\\\\n-Great drink selection (I had vinho verdo - portuguese white wine - not easy to come by)\\\\n\\\\nCons\\\\n-Food was just okay. We had a mushroom/rice dish that really didn\\'t have too much flavour\\\\n-A little pricey for the portion size and the quality\\\\n\\\\nWorth a try if you\\'re in the area but don\\'t go out of your way!\", \"I\\'ve gone here each year the last 3 years when I come to NY for work. The first time my colleagues and I came here we sat next to two men who kept ordered rounds of each oyster. We always talk about that story and this year we did what those two men did, we ordered the whole menu before we knew it. It\\'s funny how we always end up sitting at the same table the last 3 years.\\\\n\\\\nThe fettuccine with clams is very yummy, light with a dash of cheese on top. This place is very small so make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. The happy hour is a really good deal too!\", \"Upstate is a super cute date spot but can feel very cramped.\\\\n\\\\nRegular price: $7 beer and $12 wine. $2.75 per oyster east coast oysters and $3-3.25 for west coast oysters \\\\n\\\\n5-7pm every day Happy Hour: $12 for 1/2 dozen (select oysters) + pint of beer ($4 up-charge for wine)\\\\n\\\\nYou can order by different quantity, we ordered a dozen and got to try all 3 types on happy hour. All 3 were from east coast and was really good. I also liked how it came with all 3 sauces (cocktail, horseradish, Mignonette). Other spots we\\'ve encountered in NY didn\\'t.  \\\\n\\\\nThe complimentary whisky cake tasted like pound cake with slight bitter notes, moist and delicious! \\\\n\\\\nHighly recommended! As they serve quality oysters for great price during happy hour and not your regular cheap Blue Point oysters.\", \"I have been going to Upstate for years and have always loved it.  The restaurant is very small, and they only recently started taking reservations, which is great - prior to this, it was basically impossible to get a table without waiting for at least an hour or by showing up at 5pm.\\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant has a happy hour deal, 5-7: 6 oysters and a beer for $12.  It\\'s a great deal if you are able to make it there in time.  Typically, the oysters are East coast, and you have a choice of four, usually.\\\\n\\\\nApart from happy hour, I have tried the following dishes:\\\\n\\\\nEscargot (4/5): Well-cooked, tender and not tough, baked in a butter/oil/herb sauce that goes excellently with the French bread provided.\\\\n\\\\nFettuccine with Clams (5/5): An absolute stand-out.  This dish is really excellent.  The pasta is always cooked perfectly al dente and tossed in parmesan cheese.  The dish is also huge and is very filling.  I almost always order this when I go to Upstate because I can\\'t resist.\\\\n\\\\nSeared Scallops (4.5/5): Sometimes served with pasta, sometimes served with risotto, always great.  The scallops are always cooked so perfectly and are never tough or dry.\\\\n\\\\nI have also tried various crudo dishes, which have always been high quality.\\\\n\\\\nWhiskey Cake (4/5): A very solid take on a classic dessert.\\\\n\\\\nI absolutely love Upstate and would recommend it to anyone who loves seafood!\", \"Was really excited to try this place based on the amazing reviews. We don\\'t come to the city often. \\\\n\\\\nPros: the oysters and drinks (beer and wine) selection is great!!  We really enjoyed the oysters. Very fresh. The service was very good and the waiter helped us decide on what to get\\\\n\\\\nCons:  the rest of the food. We ordered the Ciopinno and the fettuccine with clams. It was so underwhelming. The food lacked flavor. The clams in the Ciopinno were too chewy I had to spit it out. And I got a piece of shell in my first bite of the muscles in the Ciopinno. \\\\n\\\\nI would definitely come back here for the oysters. But that\\'s about it.\", \"Even though everything was over salted, I\\'m still giving them 5 stars because the seafood was amazing!\\\\n\\\\nSmall space and I\\'m assuming usually packed (they don\\'t take reservations), you should get here early. I was lucky to find a seat at the bar. I had the crab cakes which were delicious - it\\'s the kind of crab cakes where you have nice shredded crab cake meat and no fillers. I followed that with the scallops over mushroom risotto. The scallops were totally over salted but otherwise well cooked. The mushroom risotto was one of the best I\\'ve ever had. My pale ale was light and refreshing. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered the monk fish to go and enjoyed it the next day. Great flaky fish that was well cooked and would have been perfect just like the scallops had it not been excessively salted. Friendly service at the bar, I\\'ll be back!\", \"I came here a good 3 times and if you\\'re an oyster lover like me this place should be like on top of your list.\\\\n\\\\nthe wait is pretty long if its packed but honestly I didn\\'t even really care cause its so good...\\\\n\\\\nI always get at least 2 dozen oysters. the prawns are amazing as well. the beer selection is on point. nothing really else to say but to just try this place out!\", \"Upstate has some of the freshest, most delicious seafood ever! What started as a stop for a quick drink ended up being a meal here, and we were so happy we stayed for food!\\\\n\\\\nWe came here for a drink because another restaurant we wanted to go to had an hour\\'s wait. The place was packed on a Sunday night, but we sat at the bar and got a round of beers and tuna tartare to munch on as we waited for our dinner call. The tuna was super fresh and tasty, with the juicy-yet-firm taste of good tuna tartare. Since this was a good sign, we went ahead and ordered the highly rated fettuccine with clams for dinner. This is as amazing as everyone says - fresh tasty clams, perfectly cooked pasta and crumbly sharp parmesan make this dish a real hit! Order this, and you will not be disappointed! We also got a couple of complimentary slices of the whiskey pound cake at the end which was quite tasty. They have oysters as well, and I\\'m not an oyster person but if you like them I\\'m sure they will be fantastic here and well worth trying.\\\\n\\\\nThe bartender was friendly and attentive, and took good care of us. The menu changes seasonally and all of their seafood comes in fresh, so I will definitely be back here again to try more of their dishes.\", \"We had reservations at 6:30 pm and were seated promptly( btw got the res. on the yelp app the day before).\\\\nThe server suggested we have the Happy hour special ( till 7 pm) with our 2 glasses of muscadet. 6 oysters and a glass of wine for $16 were a good deal so we had 12 oysters ( 3 types) for $32.\\\\nThe oysters were super fresh, and were served with 3 types of sauces.\\\\nWe then had 2 crab cakes($14) : they were ok but not great, small sized with a little after taste. They were served on a bed of corn and mesclun salad with a weird sweet soy dressing.\\\\nThe charred octopus had a nice texture but again tapas size : the risotto that accompanied the octopus was oddly oversized as if it wanted to make up for the small seafood portion.\\\\nThe  whole dish was odd: for me, risotto and grilled octopus just don\\'t work well together.\\\\nThey served a complementary whisky flavored pound cake at the end which was good.\\\\nThe bill was very reasonable and maybe, that\\'s what makes this place popular but personally, I don\\'t mind paying a little more for more flavors.\\\\nA small 4 stars.\", \\'Fettuccine and clams is divine! Main reason I made an Res there. I will be back when I get back from my trip to Italy.\\', \"It was a great experience!  I want to provide a realistic account of the wait time.  It was about 1.5 hour wait to get in which was quite disheartening, but then when I arrived I saw the size of the restaurant and saw that there was not a space. I avow that when you get in, it\\'s well worth it.  The music is nice.  \\\\n     I found the ambience is dark, intimate, and great for conversations.  It\\'s great for dates or small groups.  It is quite cozy in there.  It is not easy to balance bookbags and a down coat, so I would suggest going elsewhere if you just went on a shopping spree and need bag placeent.  \\\\n    I must say that the waiters are amazing, down-to-earth, and definitely friendly.  I would revisit due to the high level of service and the Kumamota raw oysters.  Most of the West coast oysters were fantastic.  I would highly recommend it to others to try.  Your life will be changed!  I\\'m planning my next visit as I speak.\", \"Awesome little spot in east village. Had great portions and really fresh seafood, good price too! Friend and I split the uni and the tartare for the appetizer. For the main I got the boiled pot of seafood (forgot the dish name)- seafood, mussels, clams, scallops etc, it was very fresh and tasted great. Highly recommend, I also love that this place takes reservations. It\\'s definitely a cozy spot and great location to hit up nearby bars after the dinner. High recommend.\", \"A seafood lover\\'s dream especially oysters (cause I think that\\'s what they\\'re popular for) and plus everything is really affordable, which is usually not the case for seafood! So glad my friend took me here for dinner on Thursday night- with no wait for 2 people. It was a semi warm night so the doors and windows were open and it was lovely- not too loud so it was perfect for chatting and eating. \\\\n\\\\nUni ($15)- 4/5 This dish definitely made me like uni even more. I was a little concerned about the raw egg, but after mixing it up with the carrot purée it seemed to be alright after all and I\\'m still alive. Uni with salmon roe, carrot purée and raw egg on toast was a pretty good appetizer. My friend and I easily finished this plate. \\\\n\\\\nToday\\'s Fish Special ($18)- 4.5/5 Probably my favorite dish here! Everything that I love- broccoli, brussel sprouts, potatoes, and of course monkfish! This came with a piece of lemon and honestly, it was perfection. You know I love lemon & fish together! \\\\n\\\\nGrilled Tuna ($18)- 2.5/5 Eh.. was not a fan of this dish, neither was my friend. The flavor was just odd and didn\\'t really complement the grilled tuna. Wasabi mashed potatoes? It\\'s a no from me, coming from someone who eats potato everything. Tuna was flavorless...\", \\'Delicious tapas! Good variety of oysters- fresh and juicy. Got the $12 oyster beer special with 3 different types of oysters.\\\\n\\\\nMy favorite dish was the uni, salmon roe, egg tapa-- it was the perfect creamy spread for the bread. Will definitely return to try more of their tapas and my favorite uni dish!\\', \"Day/Time: Saturday, seated at 6:30pm.\\\\nWait Time: 1 hour\\\\nSeating: We had bar seats (plenty of table seating available)\\\\nService: Prompt and friendly\\\\nDrinks: ** It\\'s wine and beer only **\\\\nFood: We had half-dozen oysters, crab cakes, tuna tartare, charred octopus, and scallop and mushroom risotto. The complimentary pound cake at the end was a cute touch. \\\\n\\\\nSmaller venue than expected, but very cute and intimate for a date night with your special someone. Our bellies were full to the brim. My favorite dishes were the crab cakes and tuna tartare. The octopus was good, but a bit too chewy for me personally. The scallop and mushroom risotto was also good, but a bit bland. This place is definitely worth a try!\", \"Visited New York with a friend for Spring Break, and decided to check out Upstate after scouting Yelp for good places to eat in the East or West Village. We were not disappointed. We arrived a bit early for our reservation and the hostess very graciously accommodated us, and then it was only even better from there. Solid service--kind, efficient, and knowledgable--and really excellent food. The oysters were great--we loved the oyster menu you could choose from!--and the clam fettuccini was excellent. The only small complaint we had was that mushroom risotto could have been a bit more integrated--the mushrooms in it were rather large and not evenly spread throughout the risotto--but that\\'s it. Overall, great meal for a really decent price, especially for the East Village!\", \\'the best seafood\\\\nthe oysters are always fresh and service is excellent \\\\ngreat location to.\\', \\'Upstate is an upscale seafood restaurant in East Village. They serve an eclectic selection of oysters, a rotating menu of beers/wines, and an array of seafood appetizers and entrees. Service here was very on point - consistently refilling of drinks, fast ordering, quick serving, friendly etc. The restaurant is open to the street, feels like an old fashioned sea food bar; there is limited seating, I had to wait 20m in queue; there are tables, high tables, and bar seats.\\\\n\\\\nOverall impressed by the quality of the food.\\\\n\\\\nOrdered\\\\nShigoku, WA - Sweet and briney oysters, most like the ocean, my favorite; fresh and consistent with other top tier oyster bars\\\\nBarnstable, Cape Cod - Fattier, meatier, a bit crunchy\\\\nMontauke Pearl, Montauke Lake - clean/crisp, well rounded\\\\n\\\\nDarbee irresistible pale ale - unfiltered PA, aromatic, not too bitter. An okay palette cleanser.\\\\n\\\\nSoft shell crab - comes with cous cous. Nicely salted/seasoned. Great fresh flavor, nice crunch. My favorite entree\\\\nScallops - well seared and seasoned, 4 to a plate of mushroom risotto. Solid dish\\\\nUni - appetizer, comes in some puree; Also plated with a raw egg, onions, roe. Eaten on bread. Not a bad dish, but the weakest out of everything we ordered.\\', \"I wish they were all day open not just half of day! \\\\nThe food is really good , is a well known place casual attire. Located on 1st ave , I had the cioppino and didn\\'t really like it , my friend had the squid salad and she really thought I was good! My other friend had the beer mussel and it was very good!!!!!!\\\\n\\\\nThe inside of the restaurant was very crowded and even with reservations we had a party of about 5 people and we had to wait over 10 minutes.  Also they have small tables for large groups . The experience was good, the food was even better .\", \"Great seafood and good service\\\\n\\\\nI liked their appetizers more than their entrees and their happy hour is every day from 5-7 and they give 6 oysters and a beer for $12. Pretty solid deal I should say. \\\\n\\\\nAlso their escargot and the uni toast was TO DIE\\\\n\\\\none star less because it\\'s pretty dark in there at night and it\\'s totally a vibe but when you bring your mom and she is getting older and can\\'t really see as well in the dark... well that\\'s a problem.\", \\'I came here last trip to The City and loved it .        We used to the Yelp App to secure seating at the Bar right before 7PM.    The place is long, narrow, and crowded, much like many places in the East Village.      We had I think in total 24 or 30 oysters.     They were fresh and I believe there were three different styles to choose from.  $12 for 6 Oysters and a great draft is quite the steal.    \\\\n\\\\nThe Bar Man, was helpful and took time to explain all drafts and oysters on the Menu.  They had a house special hot sauce which was delicious, so when here be sure to try it.    Looking around at the plates coming out after Happy Hour was over they all looked outstanding.\\', \\'Cool place to have dinner, especially their oysters (many selections) and scallops (HUGE scallop- meaty!!)\\\\nNote: long wait, long line even before open. \\\\n\\\\nTaste: Fresh!!!! and Gooood!!!!\\\\n\\\\nEnivornment: Dim, tiny some elbow to elbow but still cozy\\\\n\\\\nPrice: $$$\\\\n\\\\nService: Average - Friendly\\', \\'Ughhhhhhh. Ugh is all i can say about my experience. I was SO excited cause I\\\\\\'ve been dying to try upstate. Always heard amazing reviews from ALL my friends... food fell short would be an understatement. \\\\n\\\\nThis is a small & cozy establishment. Lighting is very dim & romantic so perfect for a casual date night. My friend & I were so excited for a night filled with amazing seafood... we ordered \\\\n\\\\nTuna tartare- the tuna was veiny. It didn\\\\\\'t taste fresh like you would expect from a tartare. \\\\nMarlin crudo- AVOID! Avoid at all costs!!! This was sooooo salty, it was inedible. It was DROWNED in soy sauce? I asked the waiter if it was supposed to taste like that and his reply was \"yes, it\\\\\\'s cured or marinated in soy sauce.\" \\\\nCrab cakes- nothing special. It was good but... nothing special. \\\\nEscargot- smelled so garlicky & fragrant! Arrived to the table bubbling hot. Much to our surprise, NO FLAVOR. There was absolutely no taste! \\\\nBaked oysters- the oysters were covered in a lot of breadcrumbs. Don\\\\\\'t remember much about the flavor.\\\\nScallops & risotto- scallops were cooked perfectly! Perfect crust on the outside, soft on the inside. OVERLY SALTY. I had to drown this dish in black pepper in hopes of balancing the salt out. \\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered a dozen oysters. The oysters were very fresh. If i was to ever come back, it would ONLY be for the raw oysters. On top of the nasty food, I felt like our server gave me an attitude when I asked certain questions about the food. His tone was very snappy which made me feel blah. He did offer to take the crudo off the bill without me asking though. That was greatly appreciated. The inconsistency in the food was mind blowing, from overly salty to bland. I just can\\\\\\'t grasp that. All in all, after spending $150 on food, I left utterly disappointed. There are much better restaurants I can leave with my taste buds satisfied for that price point.\\', \"Honestly you can\\'t beat a $12 half dozen oyster + beer :) \\\\n\\\\nMy husband and I checked this out for the first time. I had it on my bookmarks for the longest time and finally made time to go. We went on a Monday night and walked in - luckily one high top table was open for us. There was a hostess that seated us down and a waiter came right up to us to hand us a glass bottle of water and menus. \\\\n\\\\nWe already knew what we wanted - Oysters :) Wine isn\\'t part of the happy hour but it is an additional $4 to the $12 HH deal. I got the wine wine - I forgot which one it was but it was really good and paired perfectly with seafood. We also ordered the tuna tartar to share. All in all we were really full with 12 oysters and a tuna tartar dish. Service was excellent and really friendly. You see the guys in the back shucking the (fresh) oysters and nice ambiance. The space is very crowded though, so it\\'ll be hard to come with a group. I saw a group of 6 sitting in a four seater lol, didn\\'t look comfy. I will be coming back for HH! I also heard the pasta here is amazing based on some other reviews.. would love to return to tr that as well.\", \"TL;DR: Upstate is my go-to for seafood. They have awesome service and the sometimes complimentary dessert is a lovely touch.\\\\n\\\\nMy friends and I love to come for happy hour, because their oysters are super fresh and sizable. At $2.75 a pop during non-happy hour times, they can be pricy, but are totally worth it during happy hour.\\\\n\\\\nIn terms of entrees, I always get the fettuccine with clams. It is a little salty, but they give you huge, meaty clams and it\\'s very creamy. One portion is enough for a very hungry person or shared between two less hungry people. \\\\n\\\\nSometimes they also bring you complimentary pound cake with your check, which is a nice touch.\", \"This may be one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. With that said, please don\\'t let their small menu deter you. I know they only have a couple of entrees listed on here, but they actually have a few more on their actual menu. Yep, there\\'s not a lot of variety. But I can assure you that they have got those couple of dishes down to a tee. Or at the least the two that I tried!\\\\n\\\\nI came here for my girl\\'s birthday and we had agreed to get here at 5 pm (right when they open) because they don\\'t take reservations and there\\'s always a long wait. My friend arrived at 5:02 pm and there was already a line! The tables were all taken and the wait for a table would take 1 hr- one and a half hr. She ended up snagging 6 seats at the bar for our group and we arrived a couple of minutes later.  \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is extremely small and narrow. People sitting at the bar can see inside the kitchen. There were only 10 seats at the bar and a couple of tables. Bar customers can hang their belongings on the hooks behind them.\\\\n\\\\nAfter seeing how teeny tiny the place was, I understood why the menu was so small. The kitchen isn\\'t that big and there aren\\'t that many workers, hence it\\'s best to keep things simple. \\\\n\\\\nAnyway, my friend really liked the happy hour oysters. The 5 of us got the scallop special which was DELICIOUS. The risotto tasted so earthy and went well with the mushrooms. I\\'m not a big fan of seafood but the scallops were well cooked. You could taste the natural sweetness of it. The portion isn\\'t that big but just right for small eaters. Another friend got the fettuccine with clams. I got a taste of it and it was also a winner. However, I didn\\'t get that cause I\\'m not a fan of clams. She said it was better than the scallop of the day special. \\\\n\\\\nAt the end of our meal, they served us complimentary whiskey cake and even put a candle on it after we briefly mentioned it was our friend\\'s birthday at the beginning. Super thoughtful and sweet! The cake was also very addicting! \\\\n\\\\nTLDR； \\\\nSmall place hence small menu. But the food was superb. Don\\'t miss out! 10/10 would recommend!\", \\'Went here for happy hour oysters and beer. 6 oysters and 1 beer for $12 great deal. The oysters were fresh and clean thoroughly, which I loved because I hate biting into sand. They had a wide selection of beers to choose from. The atmosphere is nice and cozy, which was perfect for a cold rainy day.\\', \"My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new seafood spot to celebrate our anniversary and we came across Upstate. We tried making online reservations but this was not an option instead they allow you to check in to their waiting list on yelp when you\\'re nearby the location. \\\\n\\\\nWhen we arrived we were told we still had over a 30min wait and that we could not wait inside. It\\'s that small of an establishment. It so happened to be one of the coldest night so we went next door to a Peruvian restaurant and had some pisco sours while we waited. This could have been Upstate\\'s profit because when we finally got seated we didn\\'t order any drinks we only ordered two crab cakes appetizers they were really delicious and for our entree we had the fettuccine with clams. This was also very good and tasty. I love seafood with some citrus so I asked the waitress for some citrus she gave me a strange look but she brought me some lemon after a while. \\\\n\\\\nAlthough the place is small and the vibe was very casual for our anniversary we will definitely return.\", \"The food is salty... ummm .. it was worse than I expected\\\\nI don\\'t think i will go again ..\", \\'The oysters were great and the food was pretty good too. The oysters are definitely worth it and I would try the escargot next time. The wasabi mashed potatoes were delicious. The fettuccine with clam was good, just a little too cheesy for me.\\', \"Love it! Fresh seafood, best oysters in town! I\\'m 100% recommended I always bring my friends and family here you\\'ll never ever disappointed!\", \"One of the best dining experiences that I\\'ve had in NYC and an absolute must for all seafood lovers.\\\\n\\\\nI brought my girlfriend here for our one year anniversary since we\\'re both huge seafood fans, and Upstate delivered on every course of the meal.\\\\n\\\\nTheir half dozen oysters plus a drink ($12 with beer or $16 with wine) is a great happy hour deal and a very solid appetizer. We each tried two of the three different available oysters on the hh menu, and all three were fantastic, but the Prince Edward Island oysters in particular were my favorite. \\\\n\\\\nI had heard that the black trout small plate was the best item on the menu, and please, if you order one thing, get. the. trout. Essentially, it\\'s a thin, crispier version of salmon served in a delicious, light tomato sauce with a large almost-puréed gnocchi. \\\\n\\\\nWe also ordered the crab cakes small plate, which were legitimately the best ones that I\\'ve ever had: not soggy, not made with excess sauce, crispy on the outside, no greens, and pure crab. I\\'d highly recommend those as well. \\\\n\\\\nFor our entrees, we ordered the seafood bowl and the mahi steak. Both were delicious and perfectly simple. Just really, really good seafood that hit the spot. \\\\n\\\\nThe service was phenomenal and the dimmer, quaint ambiance is perfect for any kind of date.\\\\n\\\\nI cannot recommend Upstate enough and will definitely be back! If you love seafood, this restaurant needs to be at the top of your list. \\\\n\\\\nCheers!\", \"My boyfriend brought me here for our anniversary dinner and it was such an amazing experience!! From the food, to the service, to the ambiance, everything was perfect!\\\\n\\\\nWe are both huge seafood fans so this place was made for us! We came at 5 on a Sunday night right when they opened and were able to grab a table with no wait. The restaurant is very small but we both really liked that. \\\\n\\\\nTo start we got wine and a dozen of their happy hour oysters (4 each of the upstates own, the little shems and the oyster ponds) and none disappointed. For the wine we got the pinot noir and a sweet white and both were fantastic. As for the oysters, I think flavor wise the little shems were my favorite and I loved how large and meaty the oyster ponds were. I highly recommend all three of these! \\\\n\\\\nAs an appetizer we got two small plates the crab cakes and the trout. Wow! I don\\'t know which I liked better! The crab cakes are super meaty and crispy on the outside served over a great green salad with carrots and corn. The trout was cooked to perfection with an incredible crispy skin served with what seemed like little mashed potato logs and all swimming in the best tomato sauce I have ever had! \\\\n\\\\nFor our entrees we got two large plates, the ciopinno and the mahi steak. The ciopinno was a delicious seafood stew of clams, mussels, the fish of the day, scallops and shrimp. It also came with a side of bread to soak up the stew and you can bet we wiped that bowl clean! The mahi steak was seared perfectly served over a bed of mashed potatoes and broccoli all covered in a great red sauce, that almost had the resemblance of cocktail sauce, and it worked all so well together! I highly recommend both of these dishes as well!\\\\n\\\\nMy mouth is just watering remembering all the food we had and I can not wait to be back. Their menu changes constantly depending on the seafood available and I love that! My only regret is that my stomach isn\\'t bigger so I could try more of the dishes. The menu literally made me want to order everything!\\\\n\\\\nOur server was really great, gave recommendations throughout the meal and checked on us the perfect amount. You get slices of whiskey cake with your check, which is really tasty, and a perfect way to end the meal! I absolutely can not wait to be back here!!\", \\'Amazing food, one of the best place in NYC. Highly\\\\nRecommended!! And the service could not be better!\\', \"Great service. Good oysters. Disappointing dishes. \\\\n\\\\nOctopus still had that *thick* slimey layer on it. \\\\n\\\\nRisotto was good though. \\\\n\\\\nCrudo was super thick and super salty.

Oysters were also well priced.\\\\n\\\\nTLDR: good spot for oysters and drinks, but maybe have your main course elsewhere?\", \"This place is every bit as good as the reviews state. My dad and I came here on a Saturday night barring a 90 minute wait. We reserved a place in line through Yelp 60 minutes prior, and once we were at the restaurant, the hostess said that she\\'d seat us a few more parties later. We wandered around the nearby Rite Aid for a good half hour until we finally got a seat at the bar. We\\'d been hoping for a tabletop after such a long wait; the hostess did promise a table for us once one became available but apparently this never happened.\\\\n\\\\nWe started out with some beer and wine; I got one of the daily beer specials and it was incredible. We then ordered some small plates - the sockeye salmon, the crab cakes, and the trout. The salmon was my favorite; it was so fresh and came with bread and a delightful mustard spread that paired perfectly. The crab cakes were a little more floury than I prefer, though they were so flavorful and had perfectly crispy edges. The salad that came with wasn\\'t my favorite, the dressing was a weird combination of sweet and spicy. The trout was good, could use a bit more flavor but also crisped well. The tomato and mozzarella side and potato gnocchi that came with were absolutely incredible.\\\\n\\\\nMy dad and I were still hungry so we ordered the fettuccine with clams after all this. Guys, we were completely blown out of the water. This is the dish you need to be ordering here! The entire pot was steaming and so fragrant. The clams were unbelievably fresh, there was garlic in every bite, quantity was generous. The pasta was somehow even better; it was so cheesy, to the point where you grab a forkful and cheese just oozes and pulls off your plate. I don\\'t know if I\\'ve ever had such great pasta, it was that good. I will say that the dish was awfully heavy, so I\\'m glad that we did share rather than order individually. \\\\n\\\\nWe left full and happy and very impressed with our experience! I do wish the seating / wait system was a little more organized but otherwise there are no complaints. Will definitely be back to try out more of the menu (oysters!!)\", \\'A rough approximation of my conversation with the gentleman behind the bar who took great care of us the other night:\\\\n\\\\nMe to bartender: \"It\\\\\\'s probably been almost ten years since I was last here.\"\\\\nBartender: \"What took you so long to come back?\"\\\\nMe: \"There are just so many places to eat in New York. It\\\\\\'s difficult to make it back to the same place you\\\\\\'ve already been, even when you remember liking it.\"\\\\nBartender: \"I hear that - I live on 9th St. and I regularly stumble across places that make me go, \\\\\\'That wasn\\\\\\'t here last week.\\\\\\'\"\\\\nMe: \"Speaking of a long time... Have you been working here long?\\\\nBartender: \"Yeah, I\\\\\\'ve been working here a pretty long time...\"\\\\nMe: \"How long\\\\\\'s long?\"\\\\nBartender: \"From day one.\"\\\\nMe: \"Oh! No wonder you seem so familiar, I feel like I recall you from when I was last here ages ago.\"\\\\nBartender: \"That\\\\\\'s not surprising, I\\\\\\'m the owner.\"\\\\n\\\\nAside from some mild awkwardsauce, it\\\\\\'s extremely clear that said establishment owner runs a tight ship. My initial visit to Upstate nearly a decade ago is lost in the mists of my memory, but I clearly recalled enjoying myself. \\\\n\\\\nOn this particularly steamy summer evening where J and I both wanted a relatively light dinner, I stumbled across Upstate when looking up nearby dinner options. Not only could I remotely get in line via YelpRez, I know he loves oysters and I hadn\\\\\\'t been back in awhile. All of the signs aligned and we\\\\\\'re so glad we made the trek over.\\\\n\\\\nOur seats became available within about ten minutes of arrival and were affably welcomed to two seats at the bar by the hostess. Who knew we\\\\\\'d be served most of the evening by Upstate\\\\\\'s very proprietor?!\\\\n\\\\nNot only was he very friendly and patient with our many questions about the menu, he was also extremely knowledgeable, flawlessly offering recommendations on what to order (pro tip: we had the marlin crudo and shark at his recommendation, but it\\\\\\'s probably safe to just go with whatever\\\\\\'s fresh).\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m not as big on oysters as J is, but we went in on a dozen, two of each kind from all up and down the coast. I have to say that this tasting exercise was fun and enlightening, though! I discovered that I prefer brinier oysters in general. Winners for me were the Pemaquid and Dunbar Farms. The Dodge Cove oysters were impressively huge, but I\\\\\\'m no size queen - give me a delicious and manageable mouthful; I\\\\\\'d rather not spend half an hour chewing to get food down my throat.\\\\n\\\\nWe were pleasantly surprised at the end of our meal with an unexpected plate of whiskey cake! It reminded me of pound cake, but made for a perfectly satisfying semi-sweet ending to our light yet satisfying meal (paired with some milk stout).\\\\n\\\\nI definitely need to wait less than ten years before making a return run to Upstate. And if J\\\\\\'s reaction is any indication, he might drag me back much much sooner, too.\\', \"I LOVE this place!! If you want a meal that showcases fresh seafood and highlights seasonality, then look no further! \\\\n\\\\nI usually go with some of my girlfriends on Sundays right when it opens at 5PM. This place is ALWAYS packed, so there is a line before it opens because the seating is very limited. We usually end up sitting at the bar. \\\\n\\\\nAtmosphere: rustic open air vibe (literally the front of the restaurant is open to the street) \\\\n\\\\nFood: \\\\nHappy hour deal - 6 oysters + craft beer for $12 (you can pay extra to have wine instead). They have a great selection of fresh oysters! \\\\n\\\\nFettuccine with clams - absolutely divine. Perfectly cooked pasta with a delicious blend of garlic, olive oil, and parmesan coating every bite. We get this every time! \\\\n\\\\nHonorable mentions: crab cakes (crispy but soft on the inside, and you can really taste the crab) and charred squid salad (mmm squid enough said) \\\\n\\\\nService: very attentive and knowledgeable! \\\\n\\\\nCan\\'t wait to go back!\", \\'Good for oysters and beer. \\\\nThe entre I had was not very good. Prep and temperature of food. Flavor ok. \\\\nThe complimentary whiskey cake was good.\\', \\'We went right at 5pm to avoid a long line which was pretty wise in a cold day. The place was immediately packed.\\\\n\\\\nWe had happy hour oysters and beer, smoked salmon with bread and fettuccine. Oysters were very fresh. I am not a beer person so no comment on it. Smoked salmon was way too salty. We had to ask more bread so that we could finish the salmon. We shared the fettuccine which tasted good but the portion was definitely for one person. Staff were friendly. Price was reasonable.\\', \"I have had Upstate bookmarked on my Yelp for a hot minute now and I finally had the chance to try it with my cousin and her friend when we were (somewhat) in the area doing a low-key Speakeasy tour (Death & Co, PDT, Angels\\' Share, etc). It\\'s rare that I\\'m THIS disappointed with a place with the number of rave reviews that it has. \\\\n\\\\nI know I didn\\'t order incorrectly, either, because I had the pasta with clams, which seems to be the go-to dish. My cousin\\'s friend had the same, and my cousin ordered the scallops. Now, I will give Upstate credit where credit is due - it is particularly inexpensive for seafood in Manhattan. With that being acknowledged, I feel like I\\'ve said everything positive I needed to say. \\\\n\\\\nI found the pasta to be bland and uninspired and the clams were incredibly chewy and somewhat room temperature as well. My cousin\\'s friend felt exactly the same way, and my cousin was not blown away by her scallops. The food was easily a 3/5 - not atrocious, but I wouldn\\'t even go so far as to call it good. \\\\n\\\\nI\\'m taking away an extra star because despite the restaurant being super slow (I think it was a Sunday or something so there weren\\'t a ton of people in there) the service was even slower. We timed it and it took close to an hour from the time we ordered for our pasta to come out. I almost never ask the server about the food because I used to work in restaurants and know that a lot of the time it\\'s nobody\\'s fault...but come on, an hour is really, really bad. I should be able to order a pork chop well done and not have it take that long. \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant is your typical bumf*ck East Village hole in the wall - pretty narrow and cramped, nothing exceptional. The beer selection isn\\'t anything special. The complimentary pound cake at the end of our meal was a nice touch but, like the pasta, just wasn\\'t good. It tasted like cheap grocery store pound cake. I wanted to go out to dinner not to my grandma\\'s nursing home potluck. \\\\n\\\\nTL;DR - had to try it eventually, disappointed I did. Will not return\", \"Phenomenal oysters, from PEI\\'s, and LI up to the cape cod. The menu says not a freezer in the place, and it\\'s the truth. As a big seafood guy from RI, I know fresh oysters and all of the 4 types we had were fresh, delicious and shucked and cleaned the right way (hard to find in nyc often). The best thing we had was the marlin crudo with caviar. Just order it and thank me later. Words don\\'t do it justice. High grade marlin, solid caviar and all at an extremely reasonable price in my eyes. Very QUALITY SEAFOOD.\", \"This is one of the busiest restaurants in East Village as it doesn\\'t take reservations, and is well known for serving great value seafood dishes. \\\\nMy boyfriend and I came on a Thursday at the beginning of summer. It was early in the evening but there was already a line, though the waitress cited 20 minutes for us. We stood outside waiting with the hungry hordes of city-dwellers, and thanked our lucky stars when she called us before 20 minutes had passed. \\\\nThe waitress who took our orders was pleasant, and our food was out within 20 minutes. We had a mix of the oyster (on the list of oyster happy hour) and uni toast for appetizers. The uni toast was amazingly delicious with the egg yolk, and I\\'ve never had the likes of such a dish before. It was the standout of the night. \\\\nThe other dishes we had, the fettuccine with clams, and the seafood stew, were delicious, flavorsome and well-cooked, but not amazing. However, they were great quality dishes at modest prices compared to other places in the city. Would recommend.\", \"I was really looking forward to dining here with my friend, we decided to meet during happy hour and waited about 20 minutes before we were seated.  \\\\n\\\\nOk, so they have a really good happy hour deal, oysters and beer for a good price.  Sure the oysters are fresh and yes they were tasty, but that\\'s because they have good quality oysters. So I think the high reviews are in regards to the happy hour, if that\\'s so, sure then 4-5 stars from me! \\\\n\\\\nBut this review is to discuss the food we ordered off the menu.  I was not impressed by anything and it sure was not a memorable meal.  \\\\n\\\\nTheir menu was seasonal.  We ordered the fettuccine with clams and the cioppino.  Both were just okay, in fact, pretty bland in my opinion.  \\\\n\\\\nThe fettuccine was cooked well, slightly al dente, and it was topped with a lot of clams cooked in a buttery, garlic and some type of cheese.  If you are a lover of clams, then this dish will be perfect for you.  For me, I wanted more of the butter garlic taste to pair with the claims and pasta.  I didn\\'t get that. \\\\n\\\\nThe cioppino was a huge miss!  It was missing a lot of flavors that is usually present in a bowl of cioppino.  Lots of seafood - clams. mussels, shrimp, and fish.  But the tomato based broth was lacking a lot of flavor.  It also came with a side of toast that you can dip in the sauce. I was pretty disappointed in the food.  I was still a bit hungry after we finished everything (since I didn\\'t eat much of the food, which is rare for me) so I decided to save room for dessert.  \\\\n\\\\nService was okay.  I felt like the waiters are just so busy and just want you to order ASAP.  Don\\'t wave them down, they don\\'t like it.\", \"Been wanting to try this place for ages and finally got around to it! All the reviews I read said it was small, and it definitely is, but it\\'s not a box. There\\'s enough seating that the wait moves fairly efficiently. Pro tip: put yourself on the waitlist via Yelp ~30-40 minutes before you want to dine. Super easy!\\\\n\\\\nWe started with a selection of east & west coast oysters. The waitress recommended them and she had really great picks for us based on what we said we liked. \\\\n\\\\nFor starters we got the uni and scallop ceviche, would recommend both - they both had great flavors and the ceviche has a bit of a kick to it. \\\\n\\\\nI got the fettuccine with clams and my friend got the tuna. We both cleaned our plates (we were so full after), generous and delicious portions, and they treated us to complimentary whiskey bread at the end of the meal which was SO good (drenched in butter ... but that\\'s how to do it right!)\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll definitely be back for the oyster happy hour!\", \\'Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water... Came here for Happy Hour Oysters which was great but ended up fallin in love with two dishes here. \"Uni: maine sea urchin with salmon roe & raw egg, served over carrot puree with toast points\" and \"Fettuccine with clams: the house favorite, al dente pasta tossed lightly with parmesan cheese & olive oil\" I cannot even begin to explain how my palates felt this day. \\\\n\\\\nThe Uni was fresh, light and full of flavor. The Fettucine was creamy and there was a decent amount of clams in the dish. I would go to Upstate once a month if I could!\\', \\'As other reviewers had stated - expect a wait..but then it was a beautiful end of summer Friday night.  You can make a space on their waiting list when your within a mile from it by using your Yelp app. It worked great.\\\\n\\\\nWhile we waited, we went to the Latin place next door for a few drinks and an appetizer while we waited. It was really good as well! \\\\n\\\\nWhen it was close for us to be seated, my app texted me to let me know. Expect close dining quarters. My DH had a dozen oysters and ordered the clam fettuccine for his main. I had the scallop and mushroom risotto. \\\\n\\\\nMy DH and I go to Maine yearly (for the seafood and a getaway) and we have been to Boston Mass and New Orleans and he has had some \"amazing\" oysters and some just so so. He said these were shucked perfectly, no shell no sand. And he said they were the best he\\\\\\'s had...\\\\n\\\\nHis clam fettuccine was great. A lightly salty brine taste and cheese without being to overly cheesy. Smaller portions, but perfect when you take the train in - who wants to take some seafood on the train for an hour! \\\\n\\\\nMy risotto and scallops were delish. The scallops were prepared well. Lightly seasoned and seared perfectly. No grittiness and the risotto was creamy and delish as well. \\\\n\\\\nThe beers were ok..sorry we missed the $12 happy hour - 1/2 doz oysters and a beer from 5-7. Get there 15 minutes before they open if you don\\\\\\'t want to wait.\\', \"I wasn\\'t impressed. The food was okay but not for the prices. I think the tuna tartare tasted old and the crab cakes and risotto had no zest or life to them. The oysters were much better. But you cant really mess up raw oysters. Overall, an acceptable but underwhelming experience.\", \"I wanted to really like this place. While the oysters were outstanding everything that followed was just ok. The pasta with clams must have been left too long under a heat lamp as the dish was a lump of dense pasta and tough clams. The uni appetizer came without the carrot base and a too strong sauce while the escargot were tasty but drowned in butter. Finally, the monkfish was over cooked and leaden. We came on a very busy Friday night. Perhaps we would have been better off coming midweek when it\\'s less crowded.\", \"I\\'m usually not into east coast oysters, but Upstate happy hour has me reconsidering my choices. Their beer + oysters deal (6 oysters + beer for $12) is pretty reasonable, especially for Manhattan. The oysters themselves are deliciously fresh and well-shucked. Basically, it\\'s the gold standard oyster experience that one can only hope for. \\\\n\\\\nThey also have raw clams and small plates available (I think there were pesto or garlic mussels that smells absolutely amazing). Definitely worth a visit if you\\'re in the area, and I recommend coming early to avoid a wait.\", \"I just went to Upstate for the first time in at least a year, and realizing that my review is almost 6 years old, thought it was time for an update.\\\\n\\\\nThis is an outstanding fish bar.  Not just a happy hour bar.  If you are only coming for oysters you are missing out.\\\\n\\\\nShane the owner is always there and takes so much pride in offering the freshest fish, and now some more exotic dishes.  I remember him saying back in the day they don\\'t own a freezer, which speaks to how fresh everything always is.  \\\\n\\\\nAnd just last week he told me he is now branching out from purely local fish...just a bit...to do some other exciting things on the menu. Friday night it was Marlin, which was served as a crudo, but being such a rich fish, came across more like a seafood version of carpaccio.  It was really good.\\\\n\\\\nOne last thing I noticed for the first time is how good all the descriptions are on the menu, from drinks to entrees.\", \\'Best hidden gem in Manhattan\\\\nFresh seafood \\\\nPrice\\\\nService \\\\n\\\\nVery rare to get a welcome and  a big smile these days in Manhattan.  The female bartender knew her stuff and made us feel as easy when trying our first oysters. \\\\nFood was spot on and the beer and wine selection was fab.\\', \\'this place is ridiculous. I joined the waitlist at 7:15 and they told me I need to wait one hour. And at 10:00 I got a phone call from them and told me I need to wait for another 30-45min to get a table. What is wrong with those people? Do they really take the primary school and learn what is time? Never come to this place again.\\', \"Solid restaurant in the east village. Menu is somewhat small and obviously seafood centered. Place itself is cozy, but came on a nice day so they opened up the front which was nice as we were seated right at the window. \\\\n\\\\nLooking around the restaurant it was pretty clear the fettuccine with clams was the way to go (I think at least one person at every table had it). I ordered it and thought it was very good. I thought the pasta and sauce itself was a bit bland, but they give you enough clams that there\\'s one in every bite and it\\'s delicious. \\\\n\\\\nFor starters we had crab cakes and oysters, both were very good. My girlfriend had the scallops entree and while good, would probably skip next time. \\\\n\\\\nOverall had a great meal here and can\\'t wait to come back!\", \"I\\'ve been wanting to come to this place ever since i read about it for a while and finally made it. Arrived a little early right before opening and there is already a mini line to go on so I guess it was really good and I was right. Place was a little small but had nice decor around it, place was packed after opening, ordered the oysters and small dishes, drink had a reasonable price, always went for the heaviest beer which was amazing. Food overall was satisfying and scrumptious. I would come back again for another oyster adventure, would recommend this location to any seafood lovers. Oh and I almost forgot, they gave us whiskey pound cake on the house, very thankful for that.\", \\'I think most people go there for happy hour, so did we. We were super hungry and so we not only ordered the oysters also ordered the scallops risotto and fettuccine clams. I just think that this restaurant is highly over rated, the scallops were properly cooked but they use brown rice for the risotto which could be creative, however, it just tasted like wet brown rice, not too flavorful. The fettuccine was bad, it was overcooked, very greasy and weird tasting garlic sauce, no other flavors. (Clams were okay) \\\\nOh, almost forgot about the crab cakes!!! I do not know what else to say...it tasted just like stuffing... I could barely taste the crab meat. Would not recommend it.  \\\\nOysters were definitely on par, just go for happy hour.\\', \\'Phenomenal restaurant. Food is unreal! Staff is amazing. Cozy date spot for sure with stellar tunes.\\', \"Came here on a Monday around 6:00pm for their happy hour special and to our pleasant surprise, there was no line. \\\\n\\\\nWe started with the 6 oysters + glass of wine for $16. They had 3 types of oysters that are included in the special so we ordered 4 of each. We agree our favorite oyster was the one from Seattle (versus the east coast ones that were offered). I\\'d get 6 of just those next time. \\\\n\\\\nThen we got the charred squid salad and uni appetizers. Both were on point. Would recommend for anyone who can appreciate calamari that is unbreaded and unfried. It is served over a bed of kale with some lemon aioli or the likes. The uni was served with a raw egg and bread. Our waiter recommended mixing it all together and soaking the bread in it. Would get that again for sure. \\\\n\\\\nFor entree, we got the fettucine clams and the mahi mahi. The mahi mahi was a little salty for my taste. The fettucine clams looks like a small serving but it is rich of butter and cheese. Very filling and definitely have to share it. But very delicious. Perfectly al dente and the clams complemented it well. \\\\n\\\\nDidn\\'t have space for dessert but they brought out complimentary whiskey lemon cake (I think?), and it was a perfect ending.\", \"Upstate is all about that fresh seafood! Highly recommended for good quality, well - executed dishes with varying flavor profiles. The restaurant is relatively small so popular weekend dinner times can definitely have a wait. My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday evening and were seated immediately at the bar. I liked it because you get a view of their kitchen and the bartender is very friendly. \\\\n\\\\nSquid Salad - A crap load of soft, tender squid over sautéed kale and drizzle of honey. The squid was beautifully grilled with the yummy grilled taste to it.\\\\n\\\\nCrab Cake - two crisp on the outside, soft on the inside crab cakes with a great crab ratio. Very tasty. It laid over a bed of corn and greens with a sweet sauce. I am not a fan of sweet with savory but regardless of my personal preference, it was still a great dish! \\\\n\\\\nScallops over mushroom risotto - This dish was very evidently popular amongst the patrons and it definitely deserves that kind of popularity. The dish was clean, simple yet was packed with flavor from the mushroom. Risotto was well-cooked, not soggy but had a good chew to it. The scallops were cooked perfectly, soft to the bite. \\\\n\\\\nComplimentary whiskey cake - don\\'t miss out on this. Satisfies the sweet tooth at the end. It had a good hint of whiskey, tasting almost like a butterscotch pound cake. Yum!\\\\n\\\\nOverall, a great fresh meal! We were nicely full after these plates.  I am definitely interested in coming back and trying more of their dishes, including the fettuccine with clams. It looked amazing as I stalked to couple next to us eating!\", \"The best East Village Restaurant I\\'ve eaten so far! Small, intimate place hidden in EV. If you love seafood this restaurant is a MUST GO TO! We had the trout, fettuccine with clams (must get - you will not regret it), and the mushroom risotto w scallops. \\\\n\\\\nWe sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive! The food came out fairly quickly. Best of all this place is very well priced for its value. \\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re looking for a casual weeknight date spot, this is a go to. Only downside is that they don\\'t take reservation and we waited 20mins (original 40mjns wait). Just got to a bar next door to kill the time!\", \"Long wait even on a weeknight but I had a great meal here! Two friends and I shared:\\\\n\\\\n+ crab cakes\\\\n+ tuna tartare\\\\n+ scallop of the day\\\\n+ sea urchin\\\\n+ fettuccine with clams\\\\n+ ceviche\\\\n\\\\nThe fettuccine and crab cakes were my favorites, though the scallops were also excellent. Only thing I didn\\'t really care for was the sea urchin - we all agreed that it tasted kind of off. Anyway, overall a wonderful experience and I loved that the menu is all seafood. Free cake for dessert is a nice touch!\", \"I was high key a major fan of this place, I would move to NY just to be close to it! \\\\n\\\\nWe waited ~1hr but it was so worth it. There\\'s about 15 tables and a small bar, so Upstate doesn\\'t take reservations. \\\\n\\\\nFood 5/5+++ \\\\nWe started with the rainbow trout and it was SO. GOOD. perfectly crispy skin and flakiest fish. Served w sautéed spinach and fluffier potato gnocchi. Wow. In love. \\\\nI had the diver scallops over mushroom risotto and this was another fantastic dish. The mushroom to rice ration was like 2:1, which I thoroughly enjoyed bc I love mushrooms. The scallops were seated to perfection and so tender. \\\\nOthers ordered the cioppoli (seafood bowl in a light tomato broth) served w baguettes. Looked very yummy as well, mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops, octopus \\\\nAnd dessert was complimentary pound cake! \\\\nWhat a meal. \\\\n\\\\nAmbiance 4/5 \\\\nCasual but intimate place. It\\'s small, so super cozy and open windows and doors to the streeet, so a little loud. Rustic decor. \\\\n\\\\nPrice 5/5 \\\\n~14 for apps, ~18 for entrees. \\\\n\\\\nService 5/5 \\\\nSuperb. Split checks easily, explained menu clearly. \\\\n\\\\nNothing to complain about here at all.\", \"AMAZING! As a gulf coast native, it is refreshing to find such an great seafood place that is quaint, cool, and delicious! The oysters are delicious, along with everything else on the menu. The owner is great and is always behind the bar recommending the best! Will absolutely be a regular customer! Best oysters I\\'ve had in New York. Fettuccini and clams are the bomb, literally order anything and you will be beyond happy.\", \\'great spot for happy hour oysters and craft beer! food is always on point, upstate has quickly become my go to place in the neighborhood to bring friends. the salmon plate and fettuccini are must try dishes !\\', \\'Went here with a friend at 5:30pm on a Sunday and was able to snag the last free table.\\\\n\\\\nAfter looking through the menu, we decided to split an order of the crab cakes. The crab cakes were a decent size and had good flavor. I also enjoyed the salad they were served with.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, they had run out of the fish of the day (mahi mahi) by the time we got there, so I ended up getting a scallop dish. The scallops were cooked well, but I wish they had something a little more flavorful paired with them and the dish was a little small.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, this place is serious about seafood and does it well. It is pretty tiny, so be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait. The service was friendly and attentive and the food came out quickly. Not a bad spot for reasonably priced seafood in the East Village.\\', \"Was in NY for just three days for some meetings, and had read online about Upstate and their fresh fish, and since I was staying nearby, decided to give it a try.  From the moment I walked in, the ambience and the servers were really terrific which was followed by great suggestions by my server for wine and appetizers - got the oysters, of course - followed by the special fish of the day which is a really great deal!  Very fresh and well-prepared, and their prices are more than fair.  Will definitely be back when I\\'m next in NY.\", \\'Swung by here with 3 friends as we waited for another spot for dinner. None of us had been here before and just truly turned the corner and decided, \"let\\\\\\'s go here!\" \\\\n\\\\nI\\\\\\'m so glad we did.\\\\n\\\\n4 of us sat at the bar and got ourselves craft beer. It\\\\\\'s so rare to see a really good beer in Manhattan for only $6 so I was ecstatic (I think we all were). Friends all got 2 oysters each and while none of us knew a thing about ordering oysters (let\\\\\\'s be honest, I\\\\\\'m only good at eating, not picking) and the bartender was incredibly patient and took the time to teach us about what to look for and made his picks. I 100% value amazing service because it just makes the experience so much better. \\\\n\\\\nHighly recommend for a quick stop at the bar. I\\\\\\'ll be back next time for food.\\', \\'Considering this is in NYC, it is difficult to find relatively fancy places that offer similar ambience and food for cheaper prices. The food is not really the best, as I was not too impressed by the salmon since it did not really have the necessary flavor to distinguish its taste from the bread. The shrimp was pretty good but unfortunately there was 1/8 of the shrimp that was not fresh, but it was interesting how they already help you separate the head. The raw oysters were pretty good, and it was unfortunate to not come during happy hour to get more. Regardless, it did not matter much as I am not a huge fan of raw oysters. The crab cakes were a bit small, but at least they did not add unnecessary filling to magnify the size of the crab cake and call it a \"crab cake.\" Squid salad was solid as the squid was chewy but easily eaten.\\', \"We ended up at this restaurant just by walking by it and thinking it looked good. I\\'m glad we stopped here because 1. It was really good and 2. I had it bookmarked and didn\\'t even realize it. \\\\n\\\\nI thought the waitstaff was very friendly and offered great selections. We got some oysters and he picked out some good varieties. He also suggested the linguini and clams and the tuna dish. I got the linguini and my friend got the tuna. My friend didn\\'t know the tuna wasn\\'t all the way cooked through so she asked if she could get something else. The waiter was very nice about it and allowed her to order the same thing I got. we both thought it was very good. \\\\n\\\\nThe place is very small but there wasn\\'t a wait. Which surprised me on a Saturday night.\", \"Excellent seafood restaurant and the potential wait is proof of it.  No reservations are accepted, however you can put your name in and they\\'ll text you as your table is ready.  Additionally, there was a cool feature where you check to see how many tables are ahead of you.  On both occasions, I\\'ve waited about an hour.  Usually once our name is in, we head down to d.b.a and grab some beers there.  \\\\n\\\\nThe restaurant itself is not enormous.  Tables are tight, but you\\'re not totally on top of each other.  The service is proactive and prompt.  While some of the menu can rotate, there were certain items that appear to always be there.  I\\'d highly suggest the tuna tartare and the smoked salmon.  Usually, I end up splitting a bunch of the appetizers and calling it a meal.  On my most recent visit, we tried the trout and gnocchi.  It was a very interesting mix of flavors and frankly one I would recommend and get again.  \\\\n\\\\nTo go with the great food, there is a solid draft beer list as well as wine.  I stuck with beer, as there were a handful of local craft brewers that I\\'d not yet had the chance of trying.\", \"Came here for the oyster happy hour deal of 6 oysters and a beer for $12! The oysters were fresh (but there were a couple shell bits and pieces not washed out) and the selection of beers was good too. We got the squid salad as well, which was pretty good. The menu selection is pretty small and the restaurant itself is very dark and cozy. The food won\\'t fill you up but I think Upstate is a great way to start off the night! Come here for oysters and drinks and go eat dinner elsewhere :)\", \\'Good seafood restaurant on first ave with limited sitting and cozy interior. Comfortable sitting with cute tables. Most seafood available like oysters deep diver scallops and crawfish etc\\\\n\\\\nI had deep diver scallop with mushroom brown rose risotto and crow fish. Both were amazing and delicious. They were just to make your stomach feel better and have fun while eating.   Crow fish was spicy but no complaints at all because it does taste delicious. The red tuna caviar was like a desert on top of the dinner. \\\\n\\\\nThe polite waitress and professional stuff makes this little restaurant even better and makes you order more food even you are full. \\\\n\\\\nWhen I am in restaurant I look for 3 things. 1 the food 2 the service 3 the ambience of this 3 category is good in a restaurant, they deserve the 5 star with no doubt. This is the most convenient and fun restaurant I have been sitar.  I love it all.\\\\n\\\\nThe waiting time maybe longer just be ready and just wait for your delicious food\\', \"Ok. These people are so awesome. It\\'s not all uppity, they\\'re decently packed enough, but not too packed, they have this waiting list thing that happens to be super accurate, awesome craft beers on tap, seafood, good music, impeccably good service. I am floored. I am sitting at the bar right now, typing away furiously but still floored. So rare that you encounter service like this and Upstate deserves the utmost recognition!! Too bad I live on the west coast, but definitely will be back and I\\'ll definitely recommend this place to all my friends in NYC or visiting! My final night in NYC for\\\\nthis trip, I haven\\'t written a SINGLE review on this trip, but I\\'m posting this sh*t. Trust me. This place is AMAZING.\", \\'I went here last week with my friend for the oyster happy hour. We order the $16 dollars with wine and 3 types of oysters in a total of 6. I have been quite a lot \"oyster bar\" in the city and I had not been impressed by any of them.\\\\n\\\\nUpstate, on the other hand, surprised me a lot by its freshness and taste. All 3 kinds of oysters were tasted fresh with a scent of ocean and salty. I ate them aside with a few drops of lemon, that\\\\\\'s all you need when you are eating fresh seafood!\\\\n\\\\nWe had ordered some other main courses as well but they were just regular with no surprise. In bottom line, I would highly recommend you to try for their oysters!\\', \\'Salty food would have been good but the salt took away from the enjoyment of the flavors\\', \\'Beautiful spot, yummy food, friendly service, great music. Been here twice and will be coming back again! The tuna tartar, raw selection of oysters and fettuccine was my favorite.\\']'"
