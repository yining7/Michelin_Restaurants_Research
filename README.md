# Michelin_Restaurants_Research
Bread is the stuff for life! People love food so much that they would spend a decent amount of money for a fine dining. However, despite the fact that Michelin restaurants are the definition for the highest level of fine dining, not many people have Michelin experience. Price might be one of the issues, but some of the Michelin restaurants are really hard to reserve! This prompts our team to find those non-Michelin restaurants with Michelin quality. We believe that there are potential factors that can significantly determine the Michelin standard. Therefore, we applied data analytic methods and tools to construct our study.
